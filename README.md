To compile the program, first save the code to a c file using a text or code editor (e.g: comp3101.c) then install gcc or any c compliler onto your machine.

Open your termimal then type the command:
    gcc <c_file> -o c_file
    eg: gcc comp3101.c -o comp3101

This will compile the program. To run it, after compiling enter the command:
   ./<c_file>
   ./comp3101

These steps will compile and execute the program.
